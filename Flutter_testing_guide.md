# Flutter Testing Guide

## What are tests and why do we need them?

Tests are an important part of the software development process. They help ensure that your code works as intended, catch bugs early in the development process, and make it easier to refactor your code without introducing new bugs.

In Flutter, tests are typically written using the flutter_test package, which provides a set of tools for testing widgets, functions, and other parts of your application.

## How to cover all the corner cases?

To ensure that your tests cover all corner cases, you should consider the different input values and edge cases that your code might encounter. For example, if you are testing a function that performs a calculation, you should test it with different input values, including negative numbers, zero, and large numbers.

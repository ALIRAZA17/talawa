Talawa
======

Talawa is a modular open source project to manage the member operations of religious institutions, not necessarily limited to churches.

Core features to be developed include:


#. Membership management
#. Donation management
#. Groups management
#. Event registrations
#. Recurring meetings
#. Facilities registrations
#. Volunteer and children checkins
#. Social media integrations
#. Service planning and scheduling

This will be a Calico Challenge project in 2019. It will be written in python with close integrations with the Plone open source content management system.

This project will be written from scratch. Get your ideas ready!
